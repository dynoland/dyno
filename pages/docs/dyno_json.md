# Dyno file

The files: `dyno.json` and `dyno_map.json` serve to save your settings, being them, your dependencies and your scripts

The dyno file (`dyno.json`) is a configuration file in dyno.

In it, you specify the dependencies of your project and your scripts.

You will see next how it will be done.

# Dyno Map file

The `dyno_map.json` is the same thing as import_map.json, without any difference, we just use this nomenclature.
